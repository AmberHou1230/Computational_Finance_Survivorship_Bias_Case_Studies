# Computational_Finance_Survivorship_Bias_Case_Studies
------------------------------------------------

* **Survivorship bias** occurs when the return profile of a portfolio is based solely on existing holdings
* The reasons for a company to cease to exist are varied and may include mergers, acquisitions, corporate restructurings, or bankruptcy
* Including only the “winners” when evaluating portfolio performance will likely skew the data, resulting in overestimating its historical returns.

## Case Studies Walkthrough

### Web Parsing - iShares

* iShares is one of the biggest providers of ETFs. It is a subsidiary of BlackRock.

* Additional notes on ETFs:
  *  The upside of mutual funds is diversification. What's the downside? Buying and selling frequently generate taxable activities, which then get passed onto the shareholders.
  *  ETFs get rid of this downside (because of a tax loophole called an exchange.)
  *  In the U.S., if I buy a house and live in it for 3 to 5 years and then sell it, I will have some amount of capital gain. But if I buy a second house within a 12-month period, I don't have to pay a capital gain tax. I'll just be rolling over what the tax bill would be.
  *  Ideally one day I sell everything and I pay a big tax bill many many years from now. But nobody sells everything. They just die. In the U.S., you don't pay capital gain tax when you die, you pay a death tax :) In other words, you just keep deferring your capital gain until you don't need to pay anymore. 
  *  When I sell my first house and buy my second house, it is called an exchange, not a trade. a.k.a. no taxable realization. So somebody thought well, we can use that loophole and apply it to the stock market. Instead of buying and selling stocks, ETFs are **exchanging** stocks, therefore when you invest in an ETF, there's no tax. 
  *  If you want to be a passive investor, there is no reason for you to invest in mutual funds anymore, you just pick ETF.
